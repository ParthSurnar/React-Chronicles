🚀 Summary (80/20 Pareto Rule)
✅ Props: Use React.ReactNode, strict types for reusable components.
✅ State: Use useState<string | number | boolean>, strict unions ("light" | "dark").
✅ Events: Use React.MouseEvent, React.ChangeEvent, always type handlers.
✅ API Calls: Define response types (type User = {}) & use Promise<User[]>.
✅ React Three Fiber: Use useRef<THREE.Mesh>, strictly type props ([number, number, number]).

🚀 Master these & you’ll crush real-world React + TypeScript projects.
